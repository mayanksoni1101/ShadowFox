      <div class="about-us">
        <p>
          Bringing over 20 years of expertise, Dr. Anupriya stands as a leading
          figure in modern dentistry at Hosur. A proud alumna of the renowned
          Government Dental College, she began her professional journey after
          graduating in 2000. Her passion for delivering exceptional dental care
          was further nurtured during six impactful years at Mathura Clinic,
          where she refined her clinical skills and deepened her commitment to
          patient wellbeing.
          <br />
          In 2004, Dr. Anupriya established Sakthi Dental Clinic in Hosur with a
          clear vision — to make high-quality dental care accessible to all. Her
          dedication extends beyond private practice, reflected in her
          long-standing service with the Primary Health Center at Chandara
          Hospital, where she has been a trusted dental consultant for over a
          decade.
          <br />

          specialized treatments, we prioritize personalized care tailored to
          your unique dental needs.
          <br />
          Whether you're looking for preventive care, cosmetic enhancements, or
          restorative solutions, Dr. Anupriya and her team are committed to
          delivering excellence at every step. Because here, your smile isn’t
