      <div class="faq">
        <h1 class="heading">Frequently Asked Questions :</h1>
        <div class="faq-container">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>1. Can medicines completely cure tooth pain?</h3>
            <p>Painkillers and antibiotics only give temporary relief. Lasting relief comes when a dentist treats the
              real
              cause like decay, infection, or gum disease.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>2. Does teeth scaling damage enamel or create gaps?</h3>
            <p>No. Scaling safely removes plaque and tartar above and below the gums. It does not damage enamel or
              create
              spaces between teeth. Mild sensitivity afterward is normal and usually settles as the gums heal.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>3. Can fluorosis stains be removed by scaling?</h3>
            <p>Scaling removes only surface stains. Fluorosis is an internal stain, so cosmetic treatments like
              bleaching,
              veneers, or crowns may be needed.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>4. Can all painful teeth be treated with fillings?</h3>
            <p>Not always. If decay has reached the pulp (nerve), a simple filling will not be enough. Root canal
              treatment or extraction may be required. Fillings work best when damage is limited to enamel and dentin.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>5. Is a cap (crown) needed after root canal treatment (RCT)?</h3>
            <p>Usually yes. After RCT, the tooth becomes weaker and more likely to fracture. A crown protects the tooth
              and helps it function well while chewing.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>6. Can milk teeth need RCT?</h3>
            <p>Yes. If a baby tooth has a deep cavity and is expected to stay in the mouth for some time, child-friendly
              root canal treatment (pulp therapy) can save the tooth and prevent infection or early loss.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>7. How can I maintain good oral hygiene?</h3>
            <p>
              - Brush twice daily with proper technique and fluoride toothpaste.<br>
              - Use a soft or medium toothbrush and change it every 3 months.<br>
              - Floss or clean between teeth daily.<br>
              - Rinse after meals and visit your dentist regularly.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>8. What is the best age to get braces?</h3>
            <p>Braces are often most effective between 12–14 years, but the best time depends on jaw and tooth
              development. Some children benefit from earlier evaluation.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>9. Do all wisdom teeth need to be removed?</h3>
            <p>No. They are removed only if they are impacted, infected, decayed, causing pain, or damaging nearby
              teeth.
              Healthy, properly positioned wisdom teeth can be left in place and monitored.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>10. Is it important to replace missing teeth after extraction?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Replacing missing teeth helps maintain proper bite, prevents nearby teeth from drifting, and
              supports
              normal chewing and speech.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>11. What are the benefits of dental implants?</h3>
            <p>Implants replace missing teeth with a fixed, natural-looking option. They improve chewing, appearance,
              comfort, and can help preserve jawbone.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>12. Which toothbrush and toothpaste should I use?</h3>
            <p>Use a soft or medium-bristled brush with a small head and a fluoride toothpaste. Avoid very abrasive
              pastes
              and replace your brush every three months or sooner if bristles are frayed.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>13. What causes tooth sensitivity?</h3>
            <p>Sensitivity may be due to worn enamel, gum recession with exposed roots, tooth decay, cracks, or recent
              dental treatments. A dental examination is needed to find the exact cause.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>14. How often should I see a dentist?</h3>
            <p>Many people do well with a dental visit about every six months, but the ideal interval can range from
              about
              three months to two years depending on individual risk, so the timing should be decided with the dentist.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
