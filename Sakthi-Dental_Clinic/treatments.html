            <h1>Teeth Cleaning & Scaling</h1>
            <p>
              At <b>Sakthi Dental Clinic</b>, we offer advanced, non-surgical
              gum care using modern <b>LASER</b>
              technology for precise and effective treatment. Whether you're
              dealing with early signs of gum disease or a more advanced
              condition, our skilled professionals ensure thorough cleaning to
              restore gum health. Scaling is advised for moderate cases to
              remove plaque and tartar buildup, while more severe periodontal
              issues may require deep cleaning procedures like root planing,
              supported by LASER treatment. This approach not only treats
              existing problems but also serves as a crucial preparatory step
              before any surgical intervention.
